Netlify Deployment Guide
=====================================

Your application has been enhanced with real-world POS features including:
- Sales POS with barcode scanning
- Customer Management system
- Enhanced database schema
- Multilanguage support (English, Kiswahili, Arabic)
- Tanzanian Shillings currency formatting

To deploy the latest changes to Netlify:

1. Your site is already configured at: https://0smartv1.netlify.app
2. Since you've already pushed changes to GitHub, Netlify should automatically deploy
3. If automatic deployment hasn't started, you can trigger it manually:

   Option 1 - Via Netlify Dashboard:
   - Go to https://app.netlify.com/
   - Find your site (0smartv1)
   - Go to the "Deploys" tab
   - Click "Trigger deploy" â†’ "Deploy site"

   Option 2 - Via Netlify CLI (if installed):
   - Run: npx netlify-cli deploy --dir=dist --prod

4. Ensure these environment variables are set in Netlify:
   - VITE_SUPABASE_URL = https://gaawednckptleapfoloo.supabase.co
   - VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImdhYXdlZG5ja3B0bGVhcGZvbG9vIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NjA5MDE4NTEsImV4cCI6MjA3NjQ3Nzg1MX0.SxbE5_09a5KmTzK0tBheiruAT75QYqFgTOV0FH2SuY8

5. For the enhanced database schema, make sure to run the new migrations:
   - 001_init_schema.sql (already deployed)
   - 002_enhanced_pos_schema.sql (new enhancements)

The deployment should be complete within a few minutes after triggering.
